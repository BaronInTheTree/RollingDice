# RollingDice - JavaScript

RollingDice is a two player online game. A player wins when he achieves a final score first. The final score can be set before the start of the game. The default final score is 100.

The players take turns to roll two dice. The sum of two dice is added to the active player's current score. A player can choose to continue rolling or hold. When a player "hold", the current score is added to his total score and his round ends. 

However, when two dice result in the same face, the active player's current score is cleared and his round ends. When a player's total score is greater or equal to the final score, he wins and the game ends.
