# RollingDice

RollingDice is a two player game with the goal to achieve a final score first. The final score can be customized before the start of a new game. The default final score is 100.

The players taking turns to roll two dices. If two dices result in the same number, the player's current score will be cleared and his round ends. Otherwise, the sum of two dices will be added to his current score. 

The player can choose to "hold": his current score will be added to the overall score and his round ends. When a player's overall score is greater or equal to the final score, he wins and the game ends.
